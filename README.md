# News App using News API
This repository contains a simple Python news app that fetches the latest news articles based on user interests using the News API. To get started, you'll need an API key from News API. Here's how you can obtain it:

## Getting Your News API Key
- Go to https://newsapi.org/ in your web browser.
- If you're new to News API, sign up for an account by clicking "Get API Key". If you already have an account, log in.
- After logging in, you'll be able to generate an API key. This key will allow your Python app to communicate with the News API and retrieve news data.
- Once you've generated your API key, copy it to your clipboard. You'll need this key to authenticate your requests.

## Using Your API Key in the News App
In the Python code for your news app, replace "Enter your News app api Here" with the API key you obtained from News API. This will allow your app to make requests and fetch news data. 

## Running News app
With your API key in place, you can run the news app. It will prompt you to enter your news interests, and then it will fetch and display the latest news articles. You can select a news article by entering its corresponding index, and the app will provide you with more details about that article.

Feel free to customize and enhance the app according to your preferences!
