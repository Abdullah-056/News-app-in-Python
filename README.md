# News App using News API
This repository contains a simple Python news app that fetches the latest news articles based on user interests using the News API. To get started, you'll need an API key from News API. Here's how you can obtain it:

## Getting Your News API Key
- Go to https://newsapi.org/ in your web browser.
- If you're new to News API, sign up for an account by clicking "Get API Key". If you already have an account, log in.
- After logging in, you'll be able to generate an API key. This key will allow your Python app to communicate with the News API and retrieve news data.
- Once you've generated your API key, copy it to your clipboard. You'll need this key to authenticate your requests.
